# Task 1 - To automate vit wifi login

## Documentation

So I had tried this in the first year when I came to VIT with no success. I had set up a bashscript only to realise that logging into a captive portal is different than logging into any wifi.

### Failed Techniques

I tried python with selenium and pyautogui at first. I do not use anaconda and hence have to realy on the arch repo to fetch me python modules. Since the selenium and pyautogui packages have long been outdated, I could not use them on my system. I tried google-colab as well, no success.

## Looking up Solutions

Of course this task couldn't have been impossible, so I surfed git repos for "vit wifi" and found a lot of standard python files, a few ""one touch connect apps for android and windows", a jS here and a few shell scripts there. I ran what I could on my system, but none of them worked.

## Submission

My file submission is a bash translation of [this.](https://github.com/awasthishubh/VIT-WiFi-autoConnect/blob/master/connect.bat)
